	<p>It is not a news that the traffic situation in Lagos is very appauling and can be exhausting,<br>people 
	are left unproductive and stress as they around the city. I was in a uber sometime <br> ago and I saw my driver pick up
	his phone before he started the trip. He was trying to do a<br> quick survey on the traffic situation in routes we were
	supposed to take to my destination,<br> then I thought to myself, what if there is an application that just looks through the 
	Google <br> Map Api and returns the traffic update through a chat bot that Users can interact to quickly <br> by just inputting the a 
	specific destination and also Users can interact with other online<br> users on the traffic update and that was how this idea was birthed.</p>

	<p><b>Quantitative Research</b>: I designed a simple survey and shared<br>
	 	   it online to a get a better understanding of what people's perception <br>
	 		about the Gidipeep platform. It had a target sample size of 20 and <br>
	 		was sent to people between the ages of 20 - 40. While trying to find <br>
	 		out what people thought of the application the following information <br>
	 		was gathered:</p>

	<div class="giditext6">
	<p><b>Qualitative Research</b>: For the Research, I conducted a contextual<br> enquiry
 with three people, I sat this people down to ask them a <br>
	few questions like: What they think about the application?, If they <br> 
	would make use of the app when it is lauched and lastly What <br>
	setback they think the application has? I got postive feedback in<br>
	general and that made me go on with the project. The only set-<br>back 	
	the application as is the security issue.</p>

	<p>Shelter is a very essential amenty in life and very family or individual need to have shelter.<br>
		When my dad was building a new house, I was oppurtuned to withness the process of <br>
		building a house, which goes from, getting a land, getting a blueprint and then bulding the<br>
		house, usually in the country where we live in there are so many incredible people and <br>
		sometimes, people fall victims of fraudsters that would sell fake properties to them. <br>
		So I thought to myself, what if there is an application where the surveyor, architects and <br>
		contractors can be hired to build houses.</p>

	and sent it to people online, particularly older people and I asked <br>
	questions like: What they think about having a platform that aid <br> 
	building of a house? If they would make use of the application when<br>
	they need to build a house. The response was very postive.<br>
